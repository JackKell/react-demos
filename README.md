# React Demos

## About
This project was built to help myself (and others) better understand how single page applications are built using react. *Side Note*: I have made other projects on this GitHub page that deal with react but, this project has made the most progress and furthered my understanding the most.
## Setup
1. Install node.js dependencies.
```
yarn install
```
2. Run the project.
```
yarn start
```
3. Go to the web page that opened to see the application's output.
